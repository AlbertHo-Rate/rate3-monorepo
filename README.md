# Rate3 Network
Rate3 Network is a decentralised protocol to bridge enterprises to the blockchain through asset tokenization and cross-chain identity management. Learn more in our [primer](https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/rate3/Rate3_Investor_Primer.pdf).

This repository is a monorepo which will include protocol's smart contracts, projects and developer tools.

## Status - Pre-alpha
In pre-alpha, the team is intensively doing requirements gathering, research and pilot testing on Ethereum and Stellar - most of which are in private repositories. Demo projects and developer tools for Ethereum and Stellar will be released gradually as a form of progress update and community sharing.

This repository does not reflect true development progress of the project.
